# TODO:

- [ ] Redesign http error pages
- [ ] Implement languages & customizable language support
- [ ] Format time more nicely -> Maybe format with XXX Ago and in final state the date instead of converting to client's time? Or store in cookie//Session

- [ ] Would it make sense to use the same varible names for e.g. totalItems or gotoPage for threads and topics for the sake of the page menu?
