# Forum

PHP x MySQL Forum (using infinityFree)

# TODO:

- Make only `a-zA-Z space _ , . ? ! ( )` valid chars for thread name (same technically goes for categories)
- Set character limits and other user input limits
- Implement adding theads
- Implement user profile page
- Make post/thread inputs not show when not logged in
- Keep logout or change to fetch()
- Make initial load with PHP, all subsequent calls with Fetch (-> Makes refreshing faster by ~100ms. Subsequent calls via API are ~100ms faster than refreshing)
- Check if directory (thread or category) exists before adding posts/threads to them

- Make clearance levels and moderation tools
- Make notification system
- Implement thread search
- Implement pages
- Add user profile picture system (max. 2mb)

- Style everything
- Get mysql table creation code for README.md
